          Tula&apos;s International School is proud of its beautiful dining
          area. Dieticians have carefully planned the food that is served at the
          school each day so that it offers a variety of proteins, grains,
          fruits, and vegetables in delectable vegetarian dishes.
          <br />
          <br />
          Each item on the daily menu is carefully selected from multiple
          wholesome sources to provide delicious, nutritious dishes for everyone
