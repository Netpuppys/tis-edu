          It brings me immense pride and satisfaction to extend my heartiest
          congratulations to the Management, dedicated Staff, and the vibrant
          Student body of Tula's International School on the publication of its
          Second edition of the Year Book. This publication serves as a
          chronicle of our collective journey towards educational excellence,
          and it is with great anticipation that I share my thoughts with you
          today.
          <p className="py-1"></p>
          Tula's International School combines - respect for tradition with a
          progressive application of modern sciences, academic rigour with a
          caring heart, and individual appreciation with the warmth of a school
          community.
          <p className="py-1"></p>
          In today's world, where society is increasingly divided into smaller
          segments, Tula remains a community rich in integrity. Honesty, humour,
          and hard work form the basis of an educational process that results in
          learning for a lifetime.
          <p className="py-1"></p>
          Our dedicated faculty is at the heart of our endeavour to build an
          intellectual community. Our teachers love to teach.
          <p className="py-1"></p>
          Passionate toward the success of their students, the faculty serves as
          teachers, coaches, advisors, mentors, and friends. In every area of
          school life, the faculty seeks to challenge and inspire students to
          reach new levels of enquiry and understanding.

          <span className="text-[#b90124]">
            I invite you to join Tula's in this journey of an enriching
            educational experience for our students.
