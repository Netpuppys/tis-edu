        The Tulaâ€™s International family strives to create a positive environment
        where all students are challenged and inspired to achieve their
        potential. Academics and activities form the backbone of TIS. As a
        result, the school has been ranked among the top boarding schools in
        Dehradun.

        We believe for the Clubs to function effectively, student participation
        is a must. The more students form and manage the various committees and
        clubs the better it bodes for their overall development. These Clubs and
        Committees gives them a platform to discover and bring to the fore their
        hidden talents, so essential for an all-round education.
