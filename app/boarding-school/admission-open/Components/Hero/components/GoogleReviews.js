        "We admitted our daughter, Annika Gulabdas Gupta, in class VIII this year in Tula’s. We learned about Tula’s from internet & counsellors. At first, we were apprehensive about sending Annika at such a young age to boarding school. But now, after a passage of nearly 5 months, we are happy that we sent her to Tula’s. We discovered quite a positive change in her attentiveness, seriousness about studies, vocabulary etc. She is very much satisfied with the facilities offered at Tula’s related to education, extra-curricular activities, recreation & hygiene. We, as well as our daughter liked the behavior & responsiveness of teaching, administrative & support staff. In fact, we have shared these particulars about Tula’s in our circle & quite a few of our friends have decided to send their wards to Tula’s in near future.",

In the beginning it was very tough for me to send my son to a boarding school but the day I visited the campus the first thing which came to my mind was that this is the right place and right environment for my son to be and it made up my mind to enroll my son into the school. The day after admission when my son visited the campus, he was very happy to be there. I am very glad to see the changes in my son as he has become more responsible and disciplined. He has developed a lot not only in personality but I have seen improvement in his academics, sports and other day to day activities. I am also very proud and happy to refer other parents also to enroll their ward to the school. I must not forget to thank all the teachers and other supporting staff for their tiresome effort in making my ward excel in all fields.",
